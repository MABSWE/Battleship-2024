# BATTLESHIP 2024

This Python script brings to life the classic Battleship game in a text-based format known as "Battleship 2024". Players engage in a strategic naval battle on a 5x5 grid, attempting to locate and sink the computer's hidden battleships marked as 'S'. The game features interactive turns, where players guess coordinates to target the enemy fleet. Hits are highlighted with '*', while misses are marked with 'X'. The excitement continues until either the player or the computer successfully sinks all three battleships.
